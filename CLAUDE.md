# Writing Style Guide

Source of truth for Ricky's voice: how he actually talks in conversation. Existing blog posts are useful for format/structure, not tone.

## Voice

- **Thinks out loud** — shares the reasoning process, not just conclusions. Shows how he arrived at decisions, including false starts and course corrections.
- **Generous and appreciative** — leads with what he loves about things, even when moving away from them. Never frames a change as an indictment of the old thing.
- **Honest about uncertainty** — doesn't pretend everything is a clean rational decision. Mixed motivations are okay to admit.
- **Gives backstory through people and history** — connects tools and decisions to the humans involved. Names are important. Context matters.
- **Understated about problems** — doesn't dramatize pain points. "I don't necessarily love having multiple services to keep running" rather than "it was a nightmare."
- **Nuanced thinker** — questions even things he agrees with. Comfortable with complexity in his reasoning even while pursuing simplification.
- **Practical, not precious** — doesn't over-engineer or over-worry. If five minutes of downtime is fine, say so.

## Tone Target

- Approachable but competent — write like explaining something to a friend who's also a developer. Not lecturing, not dumbing down.
- First person, active voice, real numbers and specifics.

## What NOT to Do

- NO thesis-statement openings ("In today's rapidly evolving...", "When it comes to...")
- NO corporate buzzwords ("leverage", "streamline", "robust", "scalable solution")
- NO filler transitions ("Moreover", "Furthermore", "It's worth noting that", "Interestingly")
- NO performative hedging ("In my humble opinion", "I'd argue that")
- NO dramatic framing of small problems ("The challenge was immense", "This was a game-changer")
- NO bullet-point-heavy listicle structure — write in paragraphs like a human
- NO wrapping up with "In conclusion" or "At the end of the day"
- NO emoji
- Avoid making every paragraph the same length and structure
- Don't artificially elevate the stakes — if something was easy, say it was easy

## Blog Post Structure

- YAML frontmatter: `published`, `layout`, `title`, `tags`, `abstract`, `kind`, `sitemap`
- Use `##` headers to organize, but don't over-section — flowing paragraphs are fine
- Code blocks with language identifier when showing config or commands
- Images where they add genuine value
- Audience: Rails developers, indie hackers, one-person-framework folks
