Didi (my wife) and I have long wanted to have a proper garden space and to finally landscape and design our outdoor space to make use of our ~1-acre land in the city limits.

Optimizing for lower maintenance
 
# Front Yard
  Herbs and zone 1 things. Cold frame
  Raised beds
  Can we do perennials - bushes
  Remove tree
  Retaining wall - path for walking for us and letter carrier
  It gets hot/too sunny
  Arch on driveway?
  Deer and bunny pressure

# Strip of Land
  Ideally, make it productive
  Shared space
  Dimensions:
  Hops?
  Deer resistant stuff
  Need to talk to neighbor

# Back Yard
  Berries - Blueberries, black, raspberries
  Thoughts on playset. Leveling and landscaping. 
  Maybe goes away?

Trees - cutting down

Essentials to grow???
  Hops
  Blueberries
  Blackberries
  Shrubs for soil retention
