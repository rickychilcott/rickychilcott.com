abstract: We’re planning to build a garden and have been gathering ideas, documenting our dreams, and refining the design process as we go. Our goal is to create a space that reflects our vision while evolving through thoughtful planning and creativity.

Didi (my wife) and I have long wanted to have a proper garden space and to finally landscape and design our outdoor space to make use of our ~1-acre land in the city limits. We've used raised-bed gardens in the past to great effect, but I've also been a passive connoisseur of permaculture-related topics -- mostly through [permies](https://permies.com/) and [Wheaton Labs](https://wheaton-labs.com/)

We are optimizing for:
* lower maintenance
* food production
* utilizing the permaculture principles
* food resiliency given the changing climate
 
## Front Yard
- Herbs and zone 1 things. Cold frame
- Raised beds or hugelkultur
- Can we do perennials - bushes
- Remove silver maple tree
- Retaining wall - path for walking for us and letter carrier
- It gets hot/too sunny
- Arch over the driveway?
- We have deer, bunny, and vole/mole pressure/

## Strip of Land
 * Ideally, make it productive
 * Shared space
 * Dimensions:
 * Hops?
 * Deer resistant stuff
 * Need to talk to our neighbor

## Back Yard
 * Berries - Blueberries, black, raspberries
 * Thoughts on playset. Leveling and landscaping. 
 * Maybe goes away?

Trees - cutting down

## Essentials to grow
  Hops
  Blueberries
  Blackberries
  Shrubs for soil retention
