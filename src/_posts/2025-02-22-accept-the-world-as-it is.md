title: The World as It Is
tags:
abstract: We often want the world to match our ideals, but ignoring reality only leads to frustration. Lasting change comes from first accepting things as they are, then working patiently and persistently to shape a better future.

I love coming up with contrarian views about the world. Why? It's more fun that way. When you look like everyone else, you feel boring,

And to some extent it's true.

But is it helpful?

A lesson I keep learning over and over: "instead of treating the world as you wish it to be, accept it for what it is and work to change it over time."

Does that mean we should give up, accept the world how it is, and be hopeless. No. It means that ignoring how the world works today while pushing your particular agenda is going to end in failure. If you don't work with those in power, those who have money, those who control the system as it is to make it a more just, fair, and equitable place, you will never be successful.

When you say -- "People shouldn't judge me by the way I dress, so I'll just dress however."

Maybe that should be true. But pretending it already is won’t change how people react today. The real work is to acknowledge the bias, adapt as needed, and then slowly reshape the culture so future generations can live closer to that ideal.

Accept the world as it is. Then set about changing it—patiently, persistently, and with eyes wide open.
