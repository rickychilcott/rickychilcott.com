## More Than A Plumber

Grandpa, you fixed more than faucets and drains,
You gave us a life where joy still remains.
With channel locks ready, you showed what was true—
That no broken thing stood a chance against you.

Dancing through decades, your partner, your song,
With Betty beside you, true love stayed strong
Through parties and stories, through sunshine and tears,
Her smile was your anchor for more than sixty years.

At the lake house we gathered, where geese drifted past,
We fished for bluegill, sunfish, and smallmouth bass.
The water kept time as the hours would drift,
Patience itself was the fisherman’s gift.

You sat in that golf cart with your steady gaze,
Put me through driving tests in your measured ways.
And when you handed me that “license” with pride,
I felt like the world had opened up wide.

You bought a moped, you made it go fast,
By modifying the governor, it screamed when I asked.
You kept it well-oiled and topped off with gas,
I rode for hours while the summer sun passed.

Your pancakes were legendary—fluffy, not flat,
Each bite told a story, and we all knew that.
They weren’t just for breakfast; they filled up our hearts,
A recipe of comfort where memories start.

And evenings eating ice cream, bowls in our hand,
Those small, sweet traditions I still understand.
That life is best savored in scoops and in smiles,
In memories that stretch on for miles and miles.

Ninety-nine years of stories, jokes, and good cheer,
With Captain and Coke often strong and near.
You taught us in life—through your wit and your trade—
To take a little more than what you had paid.

Though your chair may be empty, your spirit remains,
In laughter remembered and love that sustains.
A grandfather, a Slovak, a craftsman, a friend,
A love like yours never comes to an end.
