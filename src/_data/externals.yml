    I explore how strategic planning can transform communities by helping them align efforts toward clear goals and maximize impact. I emphasize the power of transparent strategy-sharing and collaboration, introducing “co-strategic planning” as a way for stakeholders to co-create and implement initiatives that tackle systemic challenges together.

    I highlight real-world examples like the New Leaf Justice Enterprise, which addresses generational poverty, and the Athens County Foundation’s Project Co-Create, which fosters collaborative planning. Ultimately, I encourage communities to embrace strategic thinking, openness, and teamwork to drive meaningful change.
