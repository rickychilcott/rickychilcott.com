# Hi 👋, I'm Ricky

I live in Southeast Ohio, and I'm a full-stack, product-focused engineer and entrepreneur.

🔭 I’m currently working on [Stoked](https://get.stokedhq.com/), software to help DTC brands connect prospective customers to customers who love their products. Open to new things, jobs where I can write Ruby/Rails or work on AI-related developer tooling 80%+ of the time.

📜 Formerly, [Mission Met](https://www.missionmet.com/) and strategic planning software, [Causey](https://www.causey.app/).

💬 Ask me about ruby, rails, turbo, stimulus, ruby, SQLite, Postgres, LLMs, me.

🧐 When I'm not programming, I'm interested in permaculture, business, personal growth, personal finance, the future, what **you're** working on.

⚡ Fun fact I only know how to tell dad jokes.
