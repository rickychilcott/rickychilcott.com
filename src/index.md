# Hi 👋, I'm Ricky

I live in Southeast Ohio, and I'm a full-stack, product-focused engineer and entrepreneur.

🔭 I’m currently working on Mission Met and focus much of my efforts on our strategc planning software, Causey.

💬 Ask me about rails, turbo, stimulus, ruby, SQLite, LLMs, me.

🧐 When I'm not programming, I'm interested in permaculture, business, personal growth, personal finance, the future, what __you're__ working on.

⚡ Fun fact I only know how to tell dad jokes.
