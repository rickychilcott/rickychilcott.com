# Hi 👋, I'm Ricky

I live in Southeast Ohio, and I'm a full-stack, product-focused engineer and entrepreneur.

🔭 I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Imedview](https://imedview.com/), building case management software for the claims and litigation industry. On the side, I'm building [Stoked](https://get.stokedhq.com/), a platform that lets shoppers talk to a brand's happiest customers.

📜 Formerly, [Mission Met](https://www.missionmet.com/), a nonprofit strategic planning consultancy. I still run [Causey](https://www.causey.app/), strategic planning software for mission-driven organizations that grew out of that work.

💬 Ask me about [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/), [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/), [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/), [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), LLMs, AI-assisted development, me.

🧐 When I'm not entrepreneuring or programming, I'm interested in permaculture, bikes, being a dad, personal growth, personal finance, podcasts, the future, what **you're** working on.

⚡ **Fun fact** I only know how to tell dad jokes.
